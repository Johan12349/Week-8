# Introduction 
Throughout this consolidation document I will try and show how I have engaged with the module materials and met the learning outcomes.

## Fail
My biggest fail this module has been my own lack of willingness to fully engage with the more programming heavy aspects of tutorials due to previous experiences with programming which have left me overwhelmed and very hesitant when it comes to getting involved with it. This failing is incredibly significant as it has left me failing to fully engage with a number of the readings as well as failing to even truly approach any of the tutorials for week 7. In addition to this large scale fail, I have also failed in regards to collaborating with my fellow students by having sent only one message in the discord since the previous consolidation document.
## Win
I have still interacted with my classmates through annotations on readings for weeks 5 and 6, with these annotations feeling like a major improvement over those I made in the previous module. With week 5 in particular having made 15 annotations, with a mix of them being replies and originals across two of the three readings for the week. In addition to this, I feel I made a major improvement in my overall engagement with the course, and while I did not manage to fully explore the tutorials that I tried to focus on during the module, I still feel I engaged and have grasped a better understanding of the course materials through my attempts at doing them.
## Challenges
My biggest challenge remains to be time managment with the large contributor to the issue being my fluctuating work schedule. Despite this I do feel I have made considerable headway against this challenge since the previous module and have improved in my execution of my journals and logs.
Another challenge I faced during this module is in regards to the tutorials, mainly the tutorials for weeks 6 and 7. The challenge for week 6 stemmed from a difficulty in parsing the overall meaning of the data in the topic models. However, having reviewed the models this week I now better understand the general data regarding the percentage of works/frequency with which certain words appeared and how certain words were paired more frequently with others. With a noticeable realization being that words associated with more progressive and inclusive thought processes seemed to only appear together, likely indicating that they are primarily used when actively analysing the field of archaeology in these specific regards rather than being utilized in broader scopes.
As for week 7 the challenge stems from what I previously discussed in my fails. The degree to which programming is involved with the course is much greater than I expected and honestly more than what I am comfortable with. As someone taking this course as a classics (GRS) major I was expecting a sort of overview on the various digital tools within the field of archaeology, such as LiDAR, how these tools are used and the impact they have on the field. Not a deep dive into the ethics behind the use of these tools as well as the field as a whole (which was honestly a welcome surprise), and a barrage of quick introductions to various programs and programming languages that may be used. The degree to which programming and programming knowledge is being used is both overwhelming and has been personally disheartening as previous experiences with programming languages and code in general have left me with a rather sour taste in my mouth. Despite these feelings I have done my best to engage with the materials but the heavy reliance on it for the tutorials in week 7 made it very difficult for me to actively engage with them.
## Implications?
First and foremost I want to make it clear that despite what I have just said I do see, understand and appreciate the value of the programming aspects of the field and course materials. It is just my own personal feelings towards it and initial expectations of this course that have made the challenge I described so prevelant.
Moving on, I feel that many of the readings really explored the notion of how human error can seep into seemingly purely factual facets of the field such as logs, models and databases. As those who craft them can subconciously, or sometimes even conciously, form these things through a close-minded lense skewed by prejudice and bigotry. Leading to many aspects of the field, digital and otherwise, flawed on a systemic level.
## Previous Feedback
In regards to previous feedback, you gave a general outline as to how to work through the week, I have done my best to follow a general pattern for my courses, to a modicum of success, with the main issues coming again from my inconsistent work schedule.

## Changes I'm making moving forward
I think at this point my weekly schedule is about as well set as it will get and it is simply as matter of sticking to it as best I can. In other regards, I have taken a look at the materials that will be covered in module 3 and feel I will be able to engage with this rather well.
