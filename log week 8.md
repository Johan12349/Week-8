# what I was trying to do
review the previous weeks within the module and form my consolidation document.

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing
I mean I can learn from my previous consolidation document and I am technically reviewing research.

## what I did

+ Reviewed Journals and Logs
	+ Helped formulate where I have succeeded and failed throughout the module as well as where I could focus attention while I review the course materials over the week
+ reviewed the topic models
	+ tried to compare the models and use the comparison to gain a better understanding of each model

## challenges 
Struggling to best show how I have fulfilled the learning outcomes.
## thoughts on where to go next

Continue to improve my engagement with course materials as we begin the final module of the course.
